To extract, manipulate, and analyze medical records of patients using SQL to support clinical insights, patient tracking, and medical reporting.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used:

SQL (Structured Query Language)

MySQL or PostgreSQL

Cloud-hosted Database (projects.datamites.com)

🗂️ Database Details:

Database Name: project_medical_data_history

Main Tables Used:

patients

admissions

doctors

✅ Key Features / Tasks Performed:

Patient Demographics Analysis

Retrieved male patients, patients without allergies, and those within specific age or weight ranges.

Filtered patient names based on starting characters or name patterns.

Data Cleaning & Updating

Replaced NULL allergies with 'NKA'.

Generated full names and formatted name strings using SQL functions.

Health Metrics Insights

Extracted height and weight data.

Identified obese patients using BMI logic: weight (kg) / (height (m))^2.

Admissions & Diagnosis Tracking

Counted total admissions.

Tracked same-day admissions/discharges.

Filtered patients diagnosed with specific conditions like Dementia and Epilepsy.

Advanced Querying

Used aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, MAX, MIN) and HAVING clause.

Performed string manipulation and conditional logic (CASE, IF, etc.).

Grouped patients by weight categories and cities.

Date & Pattern Analysis

Analyzed admission trends by day of the month.

Extracted birth years and sorted them.

Counted patients born in specific decades (e.g., 1970s).

Custom Credential Generation

Generated temporary passwords using:

Patient ID

Length of last name

Year of birth

Doctor-Patient Relationship Mapping

Joined patients, admissions, and doctors tables.

Filtered based on diagnosis and doctor attributes (e.g., specialty, name).

📊 Sample Queries Used:

SELECT, UPDATE, JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING, CASE, ORDER BY, LIMIT

Complex subqueries and filtering conditions for multi-table operations

📌 Highlights:

Demonstrated ability to manipulate complex medical data

Applied real-world healthcare logic (e.g., BMI, age groups)

Strengthened SQL problem-solving skills in patient data systems

📄 Conclusion:

This project effectively showcases the use of SQL in managing and analyzing medical data, aiding in decision-making, reporting, and patient health tracking. It simulates real-world clinical database use cases with emphasis on data accuracy and performance.
